Cloak Coin is a project designed as an anonymous loyalty or streak program, aimed at providing users with a tool to track their progress while maintaining anonymity. The program functions as a simple gamified streak counter, allowing users to monitor their own progress without revealing identifiable information to others.

## Features

- **Anonymous Tracking**: Cloak Coin utilizes Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to ensure that tokens and token quanity remain anonymous for users.
- **Simple UI**: The front end features a user-friendly interface that enables users to connect their wallets, mint new loyalty tokens, and delete all tokens if they break their streak.
- **Inspired by Loyalty Programs**: The inspiration behind Cloak Coin stems from loyalty tokens used in programs like Alcoholics Anonymous chips or Snapchat streaks. However, Cloak Coin's focus is on providing users with a record of their streaks while preserving anonymity.

## Why Cloak Coin?

Cloak Coin addresses the need for individuals to track their progress and maintain anonymity simultaneously. Whether it's monitoring personal achievements or keeping track of streaks in various activities, Cloak Coin ensures privacy without compromising functionality.

Cloak Coin gamifies the streak counting by allowing others to break your streak without knowing the length and type of streak.
